\subsection{Data Analysis}

Microbiome sequencing data were obtained from ... In total, 1692 microbiomes were collected into OTU at levels spanned from domain to species. Microbiomes that have less than $0.1\%$ average abundance across all samples were discarded. 


First, we calculated the Alpha diversity, one of the biodiversity assessments, often used to capture the eveness and complexicity of species in a ecological community. And it was measured by Chao1, Shannon, Simpson and Fisher's indexes. A higher alpha diversity indicates a greater number of species and a more even distribution of abundances. While beta diversity is a concept that describes the variation in species composition between different ecological or microbial communities or sites. Here we used principal coordinate analysis(PCoA) to measure the Beta diversity between samples with Unweighted UniFrac distance, which is a metric commonly used in microbial ecology to assess beta diversity between different microbial communities. It measures the dissimilarity between communities based on the presence or absence of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) or taxa, without taking into account their relative abundances. After projecting samples on the first and second principal coordinates, we visually showed samples by their groups of interests including Asthma status(Group), Patient Type, Sex and BMI, then we ran adnois2 in R to test their significance. Adonis2 is a permutation-based test that evaluates whether the grouping variable has a significant effect on the overall dissimilarity or variation in the data, whose null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in microbial composition between the defined groups. In other words, it assesses whether the groups are statistically different in terms of their overall structure. Finally, we provided a table showing the discrepancies between the microbiome composition between healthy and asthmatic individuals.

\section{Statistical Analysis}

Statistical analyses were conducted using R (version 4.2.2)

Wilcoxon rank sum tests and Chi-square tests were first performed on dietary data as well as demographic variables including Age, Sex and BMI. All statistical tests were two-sided with 0.05 significance levels with adjusted p value using Benjamini \& Hochberg method.

The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model ([1](Tibshirani R. Regression shrinkage and selection via the lasso. J R Stat Soc Ser B. (1996) 58:267–88. doi: 10.1111/j.2517-6161.1996.tb02080.x)) was used to select important nutritional and microbiomal signatures that are associated with response variables of interests (asthma, atopic status and asthma severity). By penalizing the $L_1$ norm of the regression coefficient vector and shrinking some entries to zero, LASSO can be effectively used for feature selection while improving model interpretability and avoiding overfitting. We used the “glmnet” package in R (version 2.0-16) to fit the logistic LASSO regression, and used a 10-fold cross-validation to select the optimal penalty term, $\lambda$. The dietary data were log transformed so as to minimize the range of the predictor values and unify them to the same unit so that no variable is dominant in the model, while Age(continuous), Sex(discrete) and BMI(continuous) were kept as their original values without any transformation. 214 nutritional variables were collected, and 53 subjects and their covariates are recorded(Age, Sex, BMI, Atopic Status...). Though LASSO can handle nulticollinearity to some extent, to make it perform well, we would want $n \geq p$ i.e. roughly a similar number of samples and predictors and remove some highly correlated variables that may be challenging for LASSO to select. Otherwise, LASSO may have issues with instability and multicollinearity, which can lead to sensitive and inaccurate results. Therefore to validate LASSO while not dropping too many potential informative nutritional factors, we first filtered out some highly correlated variables with mean absolute correlation greater than 0.9 across the dataset and then we used bootstrap resampling scheme with 100 samples in each dataset and 1000 bootstrap replications in total, since our number of nutritional predictors after filtering is around 100(86). In some bootstrap simulation, coefficients of some variables were set to zero while in the other rounds they were not. Thus we drop 

In the logistic LASSO regression, besides nutritional variables and asthma status, we also included Age, Sex, BMI and Allergic status into our model. Since those covariates were shown to be related to asthma status.

We found a reduced microbiome alpha diversity in asthma samples by examining Chao1, Shannon, Simpson and Fisher's indexes which measure both the richness and evenness in a microbial community, indicating asthmatic patients may have a lower microbial variation in the gut.

Here significant differences were found within both Group(p=0.047) and Patient Type(p=0.015) variables based on the Unweighted UniFrac dissimilarity matrix, indicating their microbial structures may be significantly different.

In the abundance bar plot, since we use Healthy as the control group with its mean abundance in a decreasing order, thus whenever in Asthmatic group the value of a certain microbiome is not less than the previous one, then the abundance of that microboime is different from the control group's. 

No significant dietary differences ($p \leq 0.05\%$) were found between subjects with and without asthma according to the univariate analyses.

For bootstrap-based LASSO, Table 1 shows the variables selected as well as their coefficients and bootstarp standard error, where positive coefficient means that predictor is positively associated to Healthy and vice versa. Specifically, we can see that, in the order of Table 1, Age, Sex, Allergy status, Saturated fat(gms), Alpha-carotene(mcg), Theobromin(mg), MET minutes from recreational activities, Vitamin D2(mcg), Vitamin K (Dihydrophylloquinone)(mcg), Unsaturated fat(g) and Proanthocyanidin polymers (>10mers)(mg) were selected. The logistic LASSO regression results showed that demographic factors including age($\beta = 0.07$), sex ($\beta = 3.08$) and allergic status contribute to asthma status. In specific, age and sex$=2$ were negatively associated with asthma and allergy was positively associated with asthma. As for dietary variables, Saturated fat($\beta = -0.90$), Alpha-carotene($\beta=-1.11$), Unsaturated fat($\beta=-1.47$) and Proanthocyanidin polymers($\beta=-1.21$) were positively associated with asthma. And Theobromin($\beta=0.54$), MET minutes from recreational activities($\beta=0.62$), Vitamin D2($\beta=0.90$) and Vitamin K ($\beta=0.82$) were negatively associated with asthma.



\section{Discussion}

Research has shown that there is a complex and emerging relationship between the gut microbiome and asthma[]. While the exact mechanisms are not fully understood, it appears that the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome can influence the risk of developing asthma and may play a role in the severity of asthma symptoms. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in training and modulating the immune system. An imbalance or dysbiosis in the gut microbiome can lead to immune system dysfunction, which is thought to be associated with asthma development. 

Diet and exposure to allergens can influence the composition of the gut microbiome. Changes in dietary habits and exposure to allergens may, in turn, impact the risk and severity of asthma.

Lower diversity in the gut microbiome has been associated with asthma in some studies []. A more diverse and balanced microbiome is generally considered healthier.
